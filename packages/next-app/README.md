# Next Bootloader

Fine grained control over Next Js loading strategy including internal as well as third party assets.

Goals:

- [x] Precise and maintainable control over the order of requests
- [x] Browsers' Loading Piorities
- [x] Control over your app's assets as well as third party assets
- [x] React components for loading and inlining JS, CSS & Fonts (and possibly others that I did not think of yet)
- [x] Feedback on the contents of the first HTTP frame
